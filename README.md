# a smol course

This is a practical course on aligning language models for your specific use case. It's a handy way to get started with aligning language models, because everything runs on most local machines. There are minimal GPU requirements and no paid services. The course is based on the [SmolLM2](https://github.com/huggingface/smollm/tree/main) series of models, but you can transfer the skills you learn here to larger models or other small language models.

## Why Small Language Models?

While large language models have shown impressive capabilities, they often require significant computational resources and can be overkill for focused applications. Small language models offer several advantages for domain-specific applications:

- **Efficiency**: Require significantly less computational resources to train and deploy
- **Customization**: Easier to fine-tune and adapt to specific domains
- **Control**: Better understanding and control of model behavior
- **Cost**: Lower operational costs for training and inference
- **Privacy**: Can be run locally without sending data to external APIs
- **Green Technology**: Advocates efficient usage of resources with reduced carbon footprint
- **Easier Academic Research Development**: Provides an easy starter for academic research with cutting-edge LLMs with less logistical constraints

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of machine learning and natural language processing.
- Familiarity with Python, PyTorch, and the `transformers` library.
- Access to a pre-trained language model and a labeled dataset.

## Installation

We maintain the course as a package so you can install dependencies easily via a package manager. We recommend [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for this purpose, but you could use alternatives like `pip` or `pdm`.

### Using `uv`

With `uv` installed, you can install the course like this:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
uv sync
```

### Using `pip`

All the examples run in the same **python 3.11** environment, so you should create an environment and install dependencies like this:

```bash
# python -m venv .venv
# source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Google Colab

**From Google Colab** you will need to install dependencies flexibly based on the hardware you're using. Like this:

```bash
pip install transformers trl datasets huggingface_hub
```

## Engagement

Let's share this, so that loads of people can learn to finetune LLMs without expensive hardware.
